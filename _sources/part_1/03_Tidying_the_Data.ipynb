Presently, I've conducted tests using two distinctive treatments: Axida (Treatment A) and Bross (Treatment B) on three select crops: **mango**, **avocado**, and **pineapple**. The formulation for Axida is primarily based on **nitrogen-enriched organic compounds**, while Bross has a base of **potassium-rich minerals with micro-nutrient additives**. One of the intriguing metrics we measure is the gas emission from the crops post-application, which can be a direct indicator of the plant's response to these treatments.*\n",
